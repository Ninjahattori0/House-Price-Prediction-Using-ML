# House-Price-Prediction-Using-ML
The House Price Prediction project uses machine learning to estimate property prices based on features like location, area, and number of rooms. Data is collected, cleaned, and used to train models like Linear Regression and Random Forest. The model is deployed in a web app, enabling users to input property details and receive a price.
